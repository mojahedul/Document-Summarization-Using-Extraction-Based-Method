 Not Solved
 ----------
 
 - In some cases, it shows incomplete summary such as partial header name etc.
 - Since it uses extraction based method, it still lacks understanding of two or more sentences.
 - If any network issues occured during connecting, it just shows the reason, meaning it lacks proper network handling.
 - In some cases, it misses some important single words or special not frequently occurring topic names.
 
 In the very next version, I intend to fix it & usual updates.
